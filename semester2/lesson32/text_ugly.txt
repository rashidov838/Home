The Ugly Duckling  
by 
Hans Christian Andersen  
It was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the 
haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red 
legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother. The corn- fields 
and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm -house 
close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors. The other ducks liked much better to swim 
about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under  a burdock leaf, to have a gossip 
with her. At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature 
that lifted its head and cried, “Peep, peep.” “Quack, quack,” said the mother, and then they all 
quacked as well as they cou ld, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves. 
Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes. “How large the world is,” said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they 
now had than while they were inside the egg -shell. “Do you imagine this is the whole world?” 
asked the mother; “Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the parson’s 
field, but I have never ventured to such a distance. Are you all out?” she continued, rising; “No, I 
declare, the largest egg lies 
there still. I wonder how long 
this is to last, I am quite tired 
of it;” and she seated herself 
again on the nest.  
“Well, how are you getting 
on?” asked an old duck, who 
paid her a visit.  
“One egg is not hatched yet,” said the duck, “it will not break. But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw? They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to see.”
